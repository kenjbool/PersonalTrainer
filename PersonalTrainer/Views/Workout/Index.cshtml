    <p>This is where it's all going to begin. This is where I can help you create the new and improved you. 
        My job as a Personal Trainer is to help you improve yourself in anyway that YOU want too. I can spend all day 
        telling you what to do, but I want you to tell me what you want to achieve.</p>
    <br />
    <p>I'm going to take some details from you that will be stored on a secure database. I can access all clients 
        data and you will be able to access your data and only your data. The data will not be passed onto any third 
        parties and I have no intention of giving your data out to anyone.</p>
    <br />
    <h4>Using your data</h4>
    <p>I wish to make you aware of how I will use your data. I will use it to create you a program and I will 
        use this to monitor your progress. You will be able to do this in the near future but this functionality 
        has not been built yet (Sort it out, Ken!!) </p>
    <br />
    <p>Let's get started... Just click the button below and off we gooooo!!</p>
